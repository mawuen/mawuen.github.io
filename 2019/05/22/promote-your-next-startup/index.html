Which technical debt should be postponed for a later stage, and which systems should be hardened this instant? What are the main considerations?</p> <p>Technical debt gets piled up, and in many cases it is easier to pay later rather than now. For example, if you are using ElasticSearch without username/passwords, you should double check your firewall settings. After round-B your startup would probably have the manpower and budget to properly secure the ElasticSearch cluster.</p> <p>Startup culture is a bit more difficult to change &quot;later&quot;. Let's take a trivial example. Developers that are used to pushing code without code review, would complain that peer review would bog down the development, and it might even smell &quot;too corporate&quot; for them.</p> <p>So which security considerations are relevant at an early stage?</p> <ul><li><p>What security concerns were raised by customers willing to pay for your product?</p></li> <li><p>What are the security expectations  in your industry (Medical, Finance, Enterprise)?</p></li> <li><p>What are the target market (country) regulations (Data Privacy, Data Residency)? Europeans are known to have tougher regulations. Different US States have different regulations.</p></li> <li><p>Which tools and policies would not hurt your team's morale.</p></li> <li><p>How long would it take you to prepare a security risk plan (see example at the bottom of this document)?</p> <ul><li><p>What is the impact of Intellectual Property theft, business plans theft, bitcoin/ec2 theft, losing all your data ? How would it affect your sales, customers, investors?</p></li> <li><p>How can you protect against a data breach?</p></li> <li><p>How can you reduce the exposure after a data breach?</p></li></ul></li></ul> <p>We grouped together the expected security recommendations by the different phases a start-up goes through. The more money and data the startup handles, the bigger the investment in security:</p> <h2 id="phase-1-working-in-the-living-room-or-living-at-work"><a href="#phase-1-working-in-the-living-room-or-living-at-work" class="header-anchor">#</a> Phase 1: Working in the living room (or living at work)</h2> <h3 id="sharing-admin-passwords"><a href="#sharing-admin-passwords" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sharing Admin Passwords</h3> <ul><li><p>Any product has at least one user - the admin. The minimum you could do when your small startup is about four people, is to replace the default admin password with a complex password and share it with a password manager that supports sharing.</p></li> <li><p>The reason for sharing is to avoid a situation where only a single employee has permissions to the system, while another employee needs it.</p></li> <li><p>It is preferable to have a different user for each person for each service. A middle-ground is to create an âadmin' (for special circumstances), developer (for day to day work) and âservice' users (for your code). The idea is that when a developer leaves, you don't need to replace your service passwords.</p></li> <li><p>Explain to your employees that eventually they need to memorize two passwords, your laptop's and the password manager's.</p></li> <li><p>Explain to your employees not to use their &quot;home&quot; or âpersonalâ password. They have most likely been exposed, or would be exposed.

This domain requires extra care, and unlike the company domain it would probably be hosted in AWS route 53 and managed by the service engineering team itself.</p></li> <li><p>A third domain is needed for internal use and back office. This domain should be instantly and recognisably distinct, easy and quick to type. Some companies use a subdomain of the company domain. However, this means it could not be managed by backoffice service developers that need to update it frequently for small internal services. A subdomain might also cause confusion which sites are internal, and which sites are public. There is also a side benefit if you register this domain anonymously.

Some employees don't like hardening their phone (encryption and screenlock to protect the 2FA app), and feel that the company needs to buy the phone for the 2FA app to run on. That's why some organizations use yubikey instead (a small usb plug that can sense human finger touch). Like a Mobile App Push notification, yubikey protects against malware and hackers that keylog your password. The downside is that unlike their mobile phones, employees are more likely to lose the yubikey together with their laptop. So if the stolen laptop falls into the hands of a professional that can extract the passwords from the laptop then they could also login to any service with the yubikey. Another problem is that the yubikey is a USB device, and you would need to make the distinction between USB storage devices (not allowed) and the yubikey (allowed).</p></li> <li><p>Using SMS for 2FA is discouraged and should be disabled.

It's not rocket science but requires attention.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="phase-3-mass-market-or-enterprise-customers"><a href="#phase-3-mass-market-or-enterprise-customers" class="header-anchor">#</a> Phase 3: Mass Market or Enterprise Customers</h2> <h3 id="certifications-and-compliance"><a href="#certifications-and-compliance" class="header-anchor">#</a> Certifications and Compliance</h3> <ul><li><p>Once your sales starts selling to large customers, they would report back on compliance requirements and certifications related to security. First thing - don't panic. Next thing, find an employee that can handle meetings and documentations and is technical enough.</p></li> <li><p>Try to understand what sections you can get waivers, and limit the certification scope. Here are a few examples:</p> <ul><li><p>Even if you need to open another Amazon account and move a few services that only two employees have access to, that could be worth your effort. It can limit the certification only to that account and two employees.</p></li> <li><p>Consider separating production services (that serve customers) from back office services (that serve employees) into different accounts. Usually the production account would be more heavily regulated.</p></li> <li><p>Among other things, you would need to perform <a href="#prevent-hacking-of-your-internet-facing-services">Penetration Testing</a>.</p></li></ul></li> <li><p>There is an important concept called compensating controls. This is an ace card that you could use (sparingly) when you cannot enforce a certain bullet point. For example, a slack-bot that sends a message to a manager when there is a violation of a policy, is a compensating control for this policy not being enforced. In small organisations it usually makes a lot of sense to alert on rare cases, rather than enforce them.</p></li> <li><p>A big part of certifications is about processes and process documentation of various parts of the company. For small startups, open a google doc that explains when you use git, and when google docs, and which doors you lock when you are the last one to leave the office. Write it as a new employee first-day reading material and keep it up to date. This way it is both useful and would be qualified for many certifications. You might need to annotate some sentences with references to req 1.2.3, so it is easier to look it up.</p></li> <li><p>Keep an eye on the compliance/certification costs itself, and total costs (of penetration tests, man-hours, and you might need some freelance help to get it done on time for your sales cycle to complete).</p></li></ul> <h3 id="bring-your-developers-onboard-they-are-a-big-part-of-it"><a href="#bring-your-developers-onboard-they-are-a-big-part-of-it" class="header-anchor">#</a> Bring your developers onboard - they are a big part of it</h3> <ul><li><p>Developers take it very personally (and might even get angry) when you take permissions away from them. They would feel that they are no longer being trusted, compared to other developers that get to keep the admin permissions. They could feel that whoever is the driving force behind the certification is having an ego-trip at their expense. Others might feel that they are being handcuffed, bogged-down, and that they started working for &quot;a corporate&quot;.</p></li> <li><p>You cannot get everyone involved in the decision making, but you can make an effort to include representatives for different opinions that are not shy to speak up. Developers usually do not &quot;whine&quot;, they just don't get who needs all that stuff. Therefore it is crucial to keep pointing out which parts are crucial for the certification, and which are just backlog items that are being added into the certification effort along the way. Specify concrete customer names mapped to security requirements.</p></li> <li><p>Take into account the time required for automation. Automation must be used for common tasks that until recently required elevated privileges. For example, adding a new customer, or upgrading to a new version. Without automation everyone needs admin privileges, with proper automation (for example a Jenkins task), all employees can perform that operation by themselves. Changes to the procedure would obviously require peer review (pull request).</p></li> <li><p>Remind the team leaders and administrators not to use their admin privileges, and use automation for day-to-day tasks like anybody else. Admin privileges should not be used to make others jealous, but rather for surgical actions for long tail tasks that automation doesn't cover. It's a matter of leading by example and courtesy.</p></li> <li><p>Define a process for providing admin privileges for a specific component for a specific employee for a limited time. In some cases a developer needs admin privileges for two days to speed up development of a new component or automate a repetitive task. Define a process that has a logging trail, which you can present to your auditor. This is needed so developers would not need to go to the admin ten times a day, since it would create a lot of frustration for all parties involved.</p></li> <li><p>Some (small) companies define that all developers are admins. Your auditor might accept that and add a comment about that in their report.</p></li> <li><p>Reduce friction by balancing security with user experience. The last thing you want are developers that stop caring and start believing the rules don't apply to them.

Identity as a Service providers, supports also browser based authentications, smart 2FA rules to reduce friction with employees, and integration with VPN/SSH via ldap or radius.</p></li> <li><p>Some vendors do not have an Admin privilege management service.

The reason is the requirement for high technical skills needed in the first stages, and taking responsibility off the CEO/CTO that require other traits, such as participating in the sales cycle, and signing official company papers. And of course the security officer must fit into your organisation's culture.

Any investment into stopping this threat is a waste of money.</p> <p>If however you are attacked by not-Mossad you can actually protect yourself effectively with a reasonable investment. A good benchmark for deciding when your investment has transitioned from Not-Mossad to Mossad is to consider a possible, hard to stop, highly illegal attack - e.g. bribing an employee with privileged access. In other words, if the cost of hacking your passwords (i.e. brute forcing your passwords) is higher than the cost of bribing an employee with access, than there is no sense in investing more resources to protect it.</p> <h3 id="deciding-on-budget-various-considerations"><a href="#deciding-on-budget-various-considerations" class="header-anchor">#</a> Deciding on  budget - various considerations</h3> <ul><li><p>Remember that as your company grows, your attack surface and also the motivation for attacking you grows too. Over time your security budget will have to grow accordingly. This budget shows your investors that you take security seriously.</p></li> <li><p>Look at the complete risk analysis and try to close the big holes first. These are the most probable, or most damaging (or a combination of both). Focusing all your efforts on a single attack vector, would merely require your attacker to move to the next hole.</p></li> <li><p>Some requirements come from customers and compliance and are not necessarily at the top of your risk. For example, customers afraid of amazon copying their business data may require end-to-end encrypted traffic inside AWS. While it is possible that an AWS insider would steal your data, or a sophisticated malware breaks through the virtual machine isolation, this may not be at the top of your list - however it is at the top of your customer's list.</p></li></ul> <h3 id="risk-management"><a href="#risk-management" class="header-anchor">#</a> Risk Management</h3> <p>One of the first steps the new security manager will do, is to assess the different risks, and the possibility of manifestation.</p> <p>For a high level starting point you can look at the relative statistics provided by the DBIR Report:</p> <p><img src="/assets/posts/image_3.png" alt="DBIR report industry stats"></p> <p>For a more detailed list that is based on the DBIR report, look at Appendix B and C of the <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIS CONTROLS FOR EFFECTIVE CYBER DEFENSE<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> document.</p> <p>The next step is to make an educated guess of the potential business damage.
